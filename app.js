//TODO: 
//Take in form input for Character name and Initiative value, and make them into instances of character objects with a constructor function.
//Push those instances into an array.
//Sort them in decending order based on their initiative value.
//Append them to the page in order.
//Upon the end of their turn, probably a click event, move them from the top of the display to the bottom, while maintaining the correct initiative order.
